 Pi4J V2 :: Java I/O Library for Raspberry Pi :: Examples
==========================================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Pi4J/pi4j-examples.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Pi4J/pi4j-v2-examples?branch=master) 

This project contains a lot of example classes which each show the use of one
function of the Pi4J library. This project is not intended to be build as one 
application, but each class contains a main-method to run the class itself to 
demonstrate the use of a specific method, e.g. how to use a digital input.
