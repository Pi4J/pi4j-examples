##Device application to operate a FS90R stepping servo.  This servo can rotate 360 degree continuously. 
The PWM signal sent to the servo device set the direction and RPM of rotation.



 Driver for a FS90R servo motor.
 The Fs90R defines a specific PWM interface and exactly how the PWN signal
 controls the servo

   These devices do not have a customary DataSheet.  Most servo devices provide limited specifications
 for required pulse width, they just say 1 - 2 millisecond.

 The FS90 R 360 defines a specific PWM interface and exactly how the PWN signal
 controls the servo. There are many different manufacturers of the FS90 servo.
 The pulse width required for setting the servo at 0 degrees MAX Clockwise (CW) or 180 degrees
 MAX CounterClockWise (CCW) varies by manufacturer. The driver by default uses the pulse width timing as
 (low)1000 - (high)2000 microseconds. The user of this example application can change these defaults
 when first invoking the program.

 If the servo does not rotate to the expected RPM,Example to rotate faster CW  reduce the -low
  argument, to rotate CCW faster increase the -high argument. The -low -high change should be balanced or 90 degree will not properly align.
 Meaning if you reduce the -low by 200, you should increase the -high by 200, or visa-versa.
